## 📌 Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is an intelligent machine learning-powered web application designed to help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to grow based on real-time environmental and soil parameters. Developed with a strong focus on sustainability and profitability, it uses historical data and predictive algorithms to recommend the most suitable crops for a given location.

## 🧠 Project Motivation
Developed as part of my AI for Agriculture initiative under **Crop360**, this system reflects my commitment to harnessing AI for solving real-world agricultural challenges. It leverages data science and machine learning to:
- Boost productivity 📈
- Prevent soil degradation 🌱
- Support informed agricultural planning 📊

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🌡️ **Smart Input System:** Accepts data like nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- 🧹 **Automated Preprocessing:** Cleans, scales, and encodes user data for consistent prediction accuracy.
- 🧠 **Multiple ML Models:** Utilizes Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Gradient Boosting for optimized recommendations.
- 📊 **Real-Time Prediction:** Delivers precise crop recommendations using trained models.
- 🖥️ **Clean Web Interface:** Developed using Flask and HTML/CSS for seamless user experience.
